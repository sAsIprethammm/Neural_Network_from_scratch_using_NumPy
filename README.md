# Neural_Network_from_scratch_using_NumPy
Developed a neural network from scratch using NumPy, implementing weight and bias initialization, forward and backward propagation, and various activation functions. Trained the network for classification and regression tasks, demonstrating foundational deep learning concepts without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
